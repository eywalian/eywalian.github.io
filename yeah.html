<br><br>"Yeah!" is a song by American singer  yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Usher. The song is co-written by Sean Garrett,  yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Patrick J. Que Smith, Robert McDowell, LRoc, Ludacris, and Lil Jon, with the latter two as the featured artists for the song, and with Lil Jon also producing the song as well as incorporating crunk and R&B—which he coined as crunk&B—in the song's production. The song was released as the lead single from Usher's fourth studio album Confessions (2004) on January 27, 2004, after Usher was told by Arista Records, his label at the time, to record more tracks for the album.<br><br>

"Yeah!" was the longest-running number one single in 2004, subsequently topping the year-end chart on the Hot 100. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The song received a similar response in other countries, topping in other twelve charts worldwide. It was certified platinum in several countries, including Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany, and Norway, and received a two-times platinum certification in New Zealand. The song peaked in the top 10 in several year-end charts.<br><br>
